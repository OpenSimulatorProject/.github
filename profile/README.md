# Open Simulator Project (OSP)

Our project aims to create affordable and DIY simulators.

## Hub

The purpose of the hub is to fetch all the input data and send it to the PC via USB. It will be based on an arduino micro (leonardo-like). It will includes serveral slots to plug your equipement.

## Car simulator

We want to create a car simulator, composed of several elements that can be used in casual or racing driving. All of the modules can be built separately and plugged on the hub.

### Steering wheel

The base of the steering wheel will be a rotary encoder for precision. The force-feedback will be assured by a DC motor (5 or 12V). A dual motor is a possibility. The axis will be a screw (M8) mounted on ball bearings. The wheel will be attached with a 6 screw system (such as Logitech's G-series) to ensure compability with many wheels on the market. We will include a quick release mechanism to allow easy wheel change. We will also provide several custom wheels:
* Family car wheel (optional radio buttons)
* Rally wheel
* F1 wheel (optional LCD screen, LEDs and buttons)
* Truck wheel (optional buttons)

We will also make accessories to add on the base of the steering wheel:
* Paddle shifters
* Turn signals and lights switch
* Parking brake

### Pedals

The pedals will work with springs. The value will be measured by a potentiometer (rotary or linear). They will include, from left to right, a clutch pedal (optional), a brake pedal and an accelarator pedal.

### Gearshift (manual)

The gearshift will consist of 7 gears plus the reverse gear. As most of the cars only have 5 or 6 gears, you can choose on wich side you want to put the reverse gear. To delete a gear or modify the layout, you can easily change the top of the shifter. Multiple knobs will be created, somme with 5, 6 gears, reverse on the left or the right. You can then bind the gears freely to your game.

### Shifter (automatic)

The shifter, in an automatic car, will consist of a lever to select amoung **P**arking, **R**everse, **N**eutral and **D**rive.

### Sequential gearshift

The sequential gearshift (used mostly in rally), will only consist of a lever with two springs.

### Parking brake

The praking brake will be a lever that can be pull. A potentiometer will measure the angle of the handbrake. In order to release it, you will have to press a button.

### Handbrake (front and rear wheels)

The handbrake (used mostly in rally) will be similar to the sequential gearshift. A spring will assure resistance and the value will be measured by a potentiometer.

### Accessories

Possible accessories will be created, here are some ideas:
* radio
* seatbelt
* airbag
* 4x4 selector

## Airplane (Airbus)

## Airplane (Boeing)

## Fighter jet (Mirage)

## Fighter jet (F-22)
